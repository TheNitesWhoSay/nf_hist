The [nf library source headers](https://github.com/TheNitesWhoSay/RareCpp/tree/master/include/nf) are housed together with the [RareCpp source headers](https://github.com/TheNitesWhoSay/RareCpp/tree/master/include/rarecpp) until such time as nf can rely on [C++26's reflection](https://cppstat.dev/?tags=cpp26&search=reflection).
